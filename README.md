# jenkins

This is a repository created to host and document all the learnings related to Jenkins starting from basics to advanced.

We are going to write pipelines using both declarative and scripted pipelines.

### What is a piepline ?

''''
      Pipeline is nothing but flow that defines what is to happen first and what next. Typically is an acronym used in Jenkins.
''''

     Pipeline jobs can be written by using 2 ways :

        1) Declarative Approach   ( Using Jenkins provided options : Non-programmatic)
        2) Scripted Pipeline Approach  ( This is written by using Groovy) [Groovy is a wrapper to Java]

....

>>>> PS : We are going to learn groovy as well from basics to advanced level like a Cloud and Devops Engr

### Pipeline Classifications

    v0 : Freestyle ( UI )

    v1 : Scripted Pipeline ( Groovy )

    v2 : DSL /Declarative Pipelines  (Domain Specific Language/DSL)

    v3 : YAML [ Still in the development phase ]
....


### Naming Standard of a Jenkin Pipeline
